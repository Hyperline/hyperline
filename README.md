HyperLine
=========

**HyperLine is a status line plugin for [Hyper.app](https://hyper.is/)**. It shows you useful system information such as free memory, uptime and CPU usage.

## Install

* **NOTE:** HyperLine is not currently supported when using Microsoft Windows. See [this issue](https://github.com/Hyperline/hyperline/issues/57) for additional information.

To install, edit `~/.hyper.js` and add `"hyperline"` to `plugins`:

```
plugins: [
  "hyperline",
],
```

## Styling the line

We implemented the same mechanism for styling/creating css classes that Hyper uses.
This will allow you to create custom HyperLine themes the same way you would create a Hyper css theme.

## Configuring plugins
Add the names of plugins in the order in which you would like them to be displayed to your `~/.hyper.js`:

```
config: {                                                                      
  hyperline: {                                                                 
    plugins: [                                                                 
      "ip",                                                                    
      "cpu",                                                                   
      "spotify"                                                                
    ]                                                                          
  },
}
```
